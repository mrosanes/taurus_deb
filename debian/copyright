License: CC-BY
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

 1. Definitions
 .
   1. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work
   and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
   derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
   literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
   cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
   be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
   recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
   constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
   the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
   Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
   synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
   ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
   this License.
 .
   2. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works,
   such as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms
   or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works
   listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
   arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
   in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
   along with one or more other contributions, each constituting
   separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
   assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
   Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as defined above)
   for the purposes of this License.
 .
   3. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original
   and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale
   or other transfer of ownership.
 .
   4. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
   that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
   5. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
   work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
   the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
   publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
   actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
   sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
   literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
   case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
   who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
   (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
   the broadcast.
 .
   6. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
   terms of this License including without limitation any production
   in the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be
   the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
   a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
   other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical
   work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
   composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
   are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
   cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
   sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
   are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
   photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
   sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
   architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
   compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a
   copyrightable work; or a work performed by a variety or circus
   performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary
   or artistic work.
 .
   7. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
   License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
   with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
   from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
   previous violation.
 .
   8. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the
   Work and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by
   any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
   a way that members of the public may access these Works from a
   place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the
   Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
   the public of the performances of the Work, including by public
   digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
   means including signs, sounds or images.  9. "Reproduce" means to
   make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation
   by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and
   reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of a protected
   performance or phonogram in digital form or other electronic
   medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
 reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
 arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
 connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
 License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
 non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
 copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
 below:
 .
   1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
   Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
   Collections; 
 .
   2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
   Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
   reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
   that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
   translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
   English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
   work has been modified.";
 .
   3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
   incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
   4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
   5. For the avoidance of doubt: 
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
         waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
         such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License;
 .	 
  2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
         the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
         royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
         this License; and,
 .
  3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
         to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
         that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
         from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
         License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
 now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to
 make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the
 rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
 rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
  The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
  and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
   1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the
   terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
   Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the
   Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or
   impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
   License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
   rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
   License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all
   notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
   warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
   Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
   not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
   restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
   exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
   the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
   in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
   from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
   License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
   You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
   credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
   Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
   practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
   Section 4(b), as requested.
 .
   2. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
   Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
   made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices
   for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
   utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
   applicable) if supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or
   Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
   institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution
   ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of
   service or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
   parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the
   extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
   specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
   refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
   Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
   Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
   Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
   Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
   Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
   implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
   the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
   will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
   Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
   in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
   contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
   the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
   in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
   this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
   any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
   Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
   or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
   written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
   Attribution Parties.
 .
   3. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may
   be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
   Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part
   of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate,
   modify or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work
   which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or
   reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions
   (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section
   3(b) of this License (the right to make Adaptations) would be
   deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or other
   derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and
   reputation, the Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate,
   this Section, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
   national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under
   Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not
   otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
 STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
 TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY,
 OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
 DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
 IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
 LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
   1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
   automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
   License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
   Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
   their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
   remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
   7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.  2. Subject
   to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is
   perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
   Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
   release the Work under different license terms or to stop
   distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
   election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
   license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
   terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
   force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
   1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
   Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
   Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
   under this License.
 .
   2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
   Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
   the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
   this License.
 .
   3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
   under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
   enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
   without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
   provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
   such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
   4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
   no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
   writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
   consent.
 .
   5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
   parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
   understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
   Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
   additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
   You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
   agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
   6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
   this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
   Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
   amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
   WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
   Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
   on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in
   the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
   be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
   implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
   national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
   applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
   under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
   included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
   the license of any rights under applicable law.

  TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR
  "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER

  AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
  LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
  THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF

   cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
   be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
   recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
   constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
   the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the

   arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations,
   in which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form
   along with one or more other contributions, each constituting

   contains terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as
   the License Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits

   license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
   license with the same License Elements as this License.

   any means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
   digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
   a way that members of the public may access these Works from a
   place and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the
   Work to the public by any means or process and the communication to
   the public of the performances of the Work, including by public
   digital performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any
   means including signs, sounds or images.
 .
   11. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means
   including without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the
   right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including
   storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or
   other electronic medium.
 .
  2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
  reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
  arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
  connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
  other applicable laws.
 .
  3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
  non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
  copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
  below:
 .
    1. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
 .
    2. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
    original work has been modified.";
 .
    3. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
 .
    4. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 .
    5. For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
         1. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be
         waived, the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect
         such royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted
         under this License;
 .
         2. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those
         jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
         any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived,
         the Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such
         royalties for any exercise by You of the rights granted under
         this License; and,
 .
         3. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right
         to collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event
         that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society,
         from any exercise by You of the rights granted under this
         License.
 .
  The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
  now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
  to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
  the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
  rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
  4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
  made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
       1. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under
       the terms of this License. You must include a copy of, or the
       Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with every
       copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may
       not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
       terms of this License or the ability of the recipient of the
       Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
       terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must
       keep intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
       disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
       Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly
       Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
       technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of
       a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted
       to that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section
       4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
       this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself
       to be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
       a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as
       required by Section 4(c), as requested. If You create an
       Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
       extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as
       required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 .
       2. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only
       under the terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of
       this License with the same License Elements as this License;
       (iii) a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
       later license version) that contains the same License Elements
       as this License (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a
       Creative Commons Compatible License. If you license the
       Adaptation under one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you
       must comply with the terms of that license. If you license the
       Adaptation under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned in
       (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
       with the terms of the Applicable License generally and the
       following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
       URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each
       Adaptation You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not
       offer or impose any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the
       terms of the Applicable License or the ability of the recipient
       of the Adaptation to exercise the rights granted to that
       recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You
       must keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable
       License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
       the Work as included in the Adaptation You Distribute or
       Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly Perform
       the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective technological
       measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability of a
       recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
       granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable
       License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as
       incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require the
       Collection apart from the Adaptation itself to be made subject
       to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
       3. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
       Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has been
       made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
       notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or
       means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author
       (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
       Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
       parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal)
       for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright
       notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name
       of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
       supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,
       if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
       unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
       licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with
       Ssection 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
       identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
       "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
       "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The
       credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any
       reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
       Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear,
       if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
       Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a
       manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
       contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
       use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
       attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your
       rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly
       assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
       by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as
       appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
       separate, express prior written permission of the Original
       Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
       4. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as
       may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce,
       Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as
       part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort,
       mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in relation to
       the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original Author's
       honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
       jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which any exercise of the right
       granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
       Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
       modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the
       Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
       or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest
       extent permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You
       to reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this
       License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
  5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
  UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
  LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
  WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
  STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF
  TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
  NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
  ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
  DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
  IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
  6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
  APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
  LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
  EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
  WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
  DAMAGES.
 .
  7. Termination
     1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
     License. Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or
     Collections from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5,
     6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
     2. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
     here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright
     in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the
     right to release the Work under different license terms or to
     stop distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
     any such election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any
     other license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
     the terms of this License), and this License will continue in
     full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
  8. Miscellaneous
     1. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 .
     2. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation,
     Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on
     the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
     this License.
 .
     3. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
     under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
     enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
     provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make
     such provision valid and enforceable.
 .
     4. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and
     no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 .
     5. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
     parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
     agreement of the Licensor and You.
 .
     6. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in
     this License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised
     on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in
     the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to
     be enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable
     national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
     applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted
     under this License, such additional rights are deemed to be
     included in the License; this License is not intended to restrict
     the license of any rights under applicable law.

 Python License
 ==============
 .
 A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
 ==========================
 .
 Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
 Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
 as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
 principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
 .
 In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
 National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
 in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
 software.
 .
 In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
 BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
 year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations (now Zope
 Corporation, see http://www.zope.com).  In 2001, the Python Software
 Foundation (PSF, see http://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a
 non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related
 Intellectual Property.  Zope Corporation is a sponsoring member of
 the PSF.
 .
 All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
 the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
 releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
 the various releases.
 .

 Footnotes:
 .
 (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
     the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
     a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
     GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
     other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
 .
 (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
     because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
     CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
     is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
 .
 Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
 direction to make these releases possible.
